I enjoy diving deep into new tools, techniques, and technologies, building web applications, and collaborating with others to create meaningful projects. I developed a Single-Page Application (SPA) to help users learn hiragana and katakana, and later built a more advanced Japanese learning platform featuring user accounts and a database powered by AWS. My current goal is to continue growing as a developer and create web applications that positively impact how people learn Japanese.",
